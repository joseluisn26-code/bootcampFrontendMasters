                <h1>What It's All About</h1>

                <More>Whence come the thousands of photographs used every month by newspapers and magazines?, More than that, whence do the photographs come which are used by makers of calendars, postcards, for
                    advertisements, and for illustrating books, stories and articles?</p>

                <blockquote class="reduce">
                    <p>This little book is a practical, up-to-the-minute answer to the question: "How can I make my
                        camera-work
                        profitable?"</p>
                    <cite class="reduce">A. H. Beardsley,<br>
                        Publisher, Photo-Era Magazine.</cite>
                </blockquote>

                <No>At first thought, the answer is, "From professional photographers and publisher-photo-services." But
                    professional
                    photographers do not produce one-third of the photographs used, and publisher-photo-services are
                    supplied by
                    that same large number of camerists that supply publications with most of their prints, No one can deny that the greatest number of prints published are bought from amateur photographers in
                    towns
                    no larger than the average, and sometimes smaller.</p>

                <p>The camerist does not have to get in an air-ship and fly to Africa in order to produce photographs
                    that
                    will
                    sell. Read what Waldon Fawcett says, himself a success at selling his photographs:</p>
                <blockquote class="reduce">
                    <p><q>The photographer is apt to think that all his ambitions would be realised if only he could
                            journey
                            to
                            foreign shores or to distant corners of our country; or if he could attend the spectacular
                            events
                            that focus the attention of the world now and then. <em> This is a delusion. The real
                                triumph is
                                that of the photographer who utilises the material ready at hand in his own district, be
                                it
                                large or small.</q></em></p>
